        >Roofing materials for homes</a> in the Dallas-Fort Worth area need to be energy-efficient and weather-resistant to survive the stormy spring weather as well as the hot and humid summers.

Metal roofs and light colored shingles reduce the amount of heat absorbed and retained by a structure during the summer months, while also protecting against wind and hail damage.
