        >Roofing materials for homes</a> in the Dallas-Fort Worth area need to be energy-efficient and weather-resistant to survive the stormy spring weather as well as the hot and humid summers. In addition, these materials must be carefully selected, as some types of roofing materials, like reflective roofs, can help reduce energy costs by as much as 40 percent. Metal roofs and light colored shingles reduce the amount of heat absorbed and retained by a structure during the summer months, while also protecting against wind and hail damage.
